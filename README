EAIL Integration Test Suite 1.2
===============================


ABOUT EAIL-ITS
--------------

EAIL-ITS in an integration test suite for the Enlightenment Accessibility
Implementation Library (EAIL). The package also includes a set of sample
applications to be used in the testing process. The test suite tests the
completeness of the implementation of ATK interfaces in EAIL as well as
successful application registration to the AT-SPI bus and data and event flow
and triggering. The test suite is run for a set of simple single-widget EFL
applications in sample/ which implement standard Elementary widgets. The test
suite is based on an ATK-EAIL mapping supplied in parameters.ini and executed
using the py.test framework.

Full Support on Tizen devices is provied on branch "tizen".


RUNNING TEST SUITE
------------------

To run the test suite you need:
* pytest (2.3.5 or more)
* Elementary (1.7.99)
* EAIL (1.0.0 or more)

To automatically build sample applications and run all tests just run:
./run_all_tests.sh

When running test categories separately first build sample applications in
sample/ by running the makefile:
make

To run only registration tests:
py.test -v registration/tests_registration.py 

To run only mapping tests:
py.test -v mapping/tests_mapping.py

To run only action tests:
py.test -v actions/test_action_interface.py

To run only event broadcast tests:
py.test -v events/events.py

To run only tests for a specific widget and operation, e.g. only run
"children-add" and "children-delete" tests for genlist:
py.test -v -k "genlist and children" events/events.py

For more details run:
py.test -h

ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS
---------------------

An additional parameter --timeout is passed to py.test to indicate the time
that must pass after application launch before the test continues. This value
should be large enough for the application to register in the AT-SPI registry.
