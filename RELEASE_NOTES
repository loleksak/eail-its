Release notes for EAIL ITS 1.2
==============================

Prerequisites
-------------

Before running EAIL ITS, Elementary (1.7.99 or more) and EAIL - the Enlightenment Accessibility Implementation Library (1.0.0 or more) need to be installed.

Installation
------------

After downloading the EAIL ITS repository, execute the test suite (build sample applications and run tests) according to the instructions provided in the README file.

Updates
-------

For updates simply download the newest version of EAIL ITS.

New features
------------

The release provides basic integration test suite for the Enlightenment Accessibility Implementation Library. The package contains a set of parametrized python tests as well as a set of sample applications to be used in the testing process.
The test suite tests the completeness of the implementation of ATK interfaces in EAIL (according to an ATK-EAIL mapping provided in the parameters.ini file) as well as successful application registration to the AT-SPI bus and data and event flow and triggering.

Details
-------

Test criteria:
* the test applications are successfully registered and deregistered in accessibility infrastructure (i.e. the AT-SPI registry),
* a complete implementation of ATK interfaces is provided for all Elementary widgets (according to the agreed ATK-EAIL mapping),
* successful data and event flow from widget to AT-SPI bus,
* successful data and event flow from AT-SPI bus to widget,
* successful event triggering on the graphical user interface.

Issues
------

* Most of the event tests generated in events/events.py fail - this is a result of the current EAIL implementation which does not include event broadcasting for most event types.
* Generating test events for states and the widget's children objects from parameters.ini file.

Troubleshooting
